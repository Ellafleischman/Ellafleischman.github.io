               <h2>A History of Women in Tennis</h2>
               <p>
               Women's tennis is one of the most popular sports for women. It is one of the few sports in which women command fame and popularity that equal those of their male counterparts. Women's tennis is present from the first Olympic Games in 1900 in Paris and 1908 in London, but the women's doubles only appeared in 1920 at the Antwerp Games.

                  <h3>Naomi Osaka vs. Serena Williams</h3>
                  <p>
                     Naomi Osaka is one of the brightest stars in women’s tennis after winning yet another major, the 2021 Australian Open recently. While Osaka is undoubtedly one of the best tennis players in the world, her first Grand Slam win exacted a toll. During the 2018 U.S. Open, she competed against her idol, Serena Williams.
                   </p>
                   <p>For the entirety of her tennis career, Williams had been the one who inspired her to get where she was. When the match began, however, something was wrong. ESPN notes that chair umpire Carlos Ramos gave Williams a code violation for allegedly receiving coaching from the stands. Williams insisted she did not, citing that her glance at the coach was standard for every player to do. Williams’s outburst at Ramos became a bigger story than Osaka’s win. However, while Osaka regrets some aspects of her first Grand Slam, she’s also not ready to diminish or demean it, something Williams also refused to do despite the added drama. </p>

                  <p> It wasn't until Wimbledon in 1986 that yellow tennis balls were used. Also, during a match a player runs on average 3 miles all over the court. Lastly, Venus and Serena Williams were the first ever set of sisters to win Olympic gold medals in tennis. The sisters won their first Olympic gold medal in the Sydney 2000 Olympics. They now have two additional gold medals from Beijing 2008 and London 2012.
