            <h2>A History of Women in Tennis</h2>
            <p>Despite the fact that today we think of tennis as involving a lot of specialized, modern equipment, tennis has actually been around for ages. In fact, the earliest forms of tennis were played on monastery courtyards in France, with players using their hands instead of racquets. It evolved into a form of tennis called real tennis (yes, "real tennis"), which is still played today. It played an important role in the courts of medieval Europe — and, in fact, led directly or indirectly to the death of at least three kings: James I of Scotland, and Louis X and Charles VIII of France. Sort of puts today's tennis injuries in perspective, doesn't it? Tennis as we know it today began in the mid-19th century in Britain, and was referred to at the time as "lawn tennis." It was also popular with women from the very beginning.</p>
            <p>Tennis became an Olympic sport in 1896, but the first women's tournament wasn't held until the next summer Olympics in 1900. (Though it was dropped as a sport in 1924 and didn't return until 1988, due to conflicts between the International Lawn Tennis Association and the Olympic Committee.) In 1900, women from four nations competed in tennis; the first female gold medalist for tennis was Charlotte Cooper of Great Britain, who was also a former Wimbledon champion.</p>

            <p> Tennis continued to grow in popularity among both men and women in the early 20th century. New tournaments were organized, including the rest of what would become the four Grand Slams. The International Lawn Tennis Federation was formed with 12 participating nations, making tennis a truly international sport. And before long, professional players — both men and women — were going on international tours, too.
            </p>
            <p>And tennis also began to look very different, at least in terms of what women wore. From the long skirts seen above at Wimbledon in 1901, women eventually began wearing much less restrictive clothing, such as these Australian players in 1922.

            <p>In 1968, tennis's Open Era began, which opened the Grand Slam tournaments up to both professionals and amateurs. It was a major change for the sport, and it brought new opportunities for women — although there existed a major gap between how much men and women earned in prize money.</p>
         <p>Stars of the early days of the Open Era include women like Margaret Court, pictured above, who holds the record for the most Grand Slam victories. Another star, Billie Jean King, helped found the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), which still exists today and which hosts the US Open every year, to advocate for gender equality in the sport. Naturally, the US Open became the first Grand Slam to give male and female winners equal prize money, starting in 1973.</p>

                  <h3>Breaking the Color Barrier</h3>
                  <p>
                     Although women have been involved in tennis from the beginning, the sport was not half so egalitarian in regards to race, and remained a highly segregated sport well into the 20th century. The first African American player to break into tennis was Althea Gibson, pictured above, who became the first person of color to win a Grand Slam when she won the French Open in 1956. It was a time when the United States still had segregated drinking fountains, making her success in the all-white world of tennis all the more remarkable. </p>
                     <p>All in all, Gibson won 11 Grand Slam tournaments over the course of her career, before going on to become a professional golfer. She paved the way for more people of color in the sport, such as Arthur Ashe or Katrina Adams, who is currently the president of the United States Tennis Association, and, of course, the Williams sisters.

                  <p>
                     After years of women advocating for equal prize money, in 2007 Wimbledon became the last Grand Slam to equalize their prize money. The change was thanks in large part to pressure from both the WTA and tennis stars, such as Venus Williams.
